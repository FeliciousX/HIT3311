Lecture 1 - Introduction
=========

#### Operation team ####
- Deploy
- Upgrade
- Support
- Raise and Track Issues

#### Development team
- Analyze
- Design
- Construct
- Deploy and Maintain

There is an overlap but development team mostly focus on before deployment. Operations team focuses after deployment.

Software Deployment is more than installing software.
Software Maintenance takes place after Software Deployment.
Software Maintenance is about correcting faults, improving performance or other attributes or adapting the product to a new environment.
Software Evolution is the outcome of Software Maintenance.

Software Evolution fits into `general laws` . Which are Lehman's Law:-

1. Continuing Change
2. Increasing Complexity
3. Self-Regulation
4. Invariant Work Rate
5. Conservation of Familiarity
6. Continuing Growth
7. Declining Quality
8. Feedback Driven
