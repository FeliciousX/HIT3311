Lecture 1 - Introduction
=========

#### Operation team ####
- Deploy
- Upgrade
- Support
- Raise and Track Issues

#### Development team
- Analyze
- Design
- Construct
- Deploy and Maintain

There is an overlap but development team mostly focus on before deployment. Operations team focuses after deployment.

Software Deployment is more than installing software.
Software Maintenance takes place after Software Deployment.
Software Maintenance is about correcting faults, improving performance or other attributes or adapting the product to a new environment.
Software Evolution is the outcome of Software Maintenance.

Software Evolution fits into `general laws` . Which are Lehman's Law:-

1. Continuing Change
2. Increasing Complexity
3. Self-Regulation
4. Invariant Work Rate
5. Conservation of Familiarity
6. Continuing Growth
7. Declining Quality
8. Feedback Driven

Lecture 2 - Deployment Fundamentals
=========
Focusing on the `Release` part of the Carzaniga Model
Steps in Release Activity:-
- Packaging
- Advertising

Types of Environments
- Development
- Testing
- Staging
- Live/Production

#### Package ####
A collection of files with instructions on what to do with them.
- Executables with required libs
- Meta-data
- Data files and Configuration Info

Example of Packaging methods are `ZIP`, `MSI`, `RPM`, `JAR`, `DEB`, `DMG`, etc.

#### Advertise ####
- Licensing
- Support
- Roadmap

##### Licensing #####
3 types of License:-
1. Highly Restrictive / Viral / Reciprocal (e.g. GPL)
2. Restrictive (e.g. LGPL, Mozilla)
3. Un-restrictive (e.g. BDS, Apache)

##### Support #####
Types of supports that can be given:-
- FAQ
- Email, IM or Telephone
- Issue Reporting
- Quick start Guide / User Manual
- Knowledge Base (Wiki)
- Discussion boards

##### Product Roadmap #####
Future plan of the product.
Improves customer confidence
